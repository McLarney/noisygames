I think I need a generator setup for the types of experiments to run. Honestly I'd like to be able to initialize stuff in a much cleaner way, preferably just changing the name of a particular experiment.

Round Robin Requires:
-strategies
-number of strategy instances per strategy
-strategy parameters

Evolutionary Stochastic Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
-number of rounds to play over
-probability of mutation
-probability of matchup

Really I'd like to have a file for each one of these variations.

Then each of these is interfaced through a generator.rs file

The strategies interfacing should be done in the player.rs file. the fact that it's in main is really not ideal.
Okay we're up to date, so I should be totally okay to change a bunch of this stuff.

Eh or maybe it should be maintained in a strategies.rs file.

player.rs is responsible for the varieties of strategies
strategies.rs is responsible for the interfacing with said strategies
testbed.rs is responsible for constructing matchups

matrix initialization should not be in the main file. It should be in a config file that is the imported into rust for these runs.

Need to figure out metadata.
